Refactor as a Svelte Component:

    Gender

      If gender is a kind of doing an incessant activity
      carried out, in part, without knowledge and without
      will, it is therefore not automatic or mechanical.
      Rather, it is a practice of improvisation within a
      scene of embarrassment. Furthermore, no one “does”
      their gender alone. One is always “doing” with or for
      another, even if the other is only imaginary. What I
      call my “own” genre may sometimes appear as something
      I authored or, indeed, owned by me. But the terms that
      constitute the genre itself are, from the beginning,
      outside of themselves, beyond themselves in a
      sociability that does not have a single author (and
      that radically contests the very notion of
      authorship).

    const range = document.createRange();
    range.selectNodeContents(document.body);
    range.setEndBefore(clickedElement);
    const textBeforeClick = range.toString();

    // Calculate the position of the click in the full text
    const clickPosition = textBeforeClick.length;

    // Extract the text from the clicked position to the end
    text = allText.slice(clickPosition);

    console.log("Text from click position:", text); // Debugging

## Svelte Component for Translate Button Design (2025-02-26)

### ❓ Question 1:
*(truncated)*

Transform this into a Svelte Component called TranslateButton, 
I want to import it
Do you think its better to keep it on the MainHeader as an Icon or as a floating button?

    function googleTranslateElementInit() {
      new google.translate.TranslateElement({ pageLanguage: 'auto' }, 'google_translate_element');
    }

    function toggleTranslate() {
      const translateDiv = document.getElementById("google_translate_element");
      translateDiv.style.display = translateDiv.style.display === "none" ? "block" : "none";
    }

    /* Estilo do ícone */
    #translate-icon {
      position: fixed;
      bottom: 20px;
      right: 20px;
      cursor: pointer;
      z-index: 1000;
    }

    #translate-icon img {
      width: 40px;
      height: 40px;
    }

    /* Estilo do widget */
    #google_translate_element {
      position: fixed;
      bottom: 60px;
      right: 20px;
      background: white;
      padding: 10px;
      border-radius: 5px;
      box-shadow: 0px 4px 6px rgba(0,... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 2:
4:00:12 PM [vite] Internal server error: /home/zaya/Downloads/Zayas/zayaweb/src/lib/components/TranslateButton.svelte:60:13 Unexpected input
  Plugin: vite-plugin-svelte

   58 |      box-shadow: 0px 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);

   60 |      display: {
                      ^
   61 |        isvisible? "block" : "none";
   62 |      }

### ❓ Question 3:
Fix the Styling to Visible, the widget is not showing on the screen
Maybe the z index and others

### ❓ Question 4:
After selection the language on the Translate Widget, I want to set isVisible to false
and I want don't want to display the iframe from the Translate widget

### ❓ Question 5:
Dont think it's working, nothing is changing here 

const observer = new MutationObserver((mutations) => {
        mutations.forEach((mutation) => {
          // Check if the widget's iframe is added to the DOM
          console.log(mutation);
          if (
            mutation.type === "childList" &&
            mutation.addedNodes.length > 0
          ) {
            const iframe = document.querySelector(
              "#google_translate_element iframe"
            );
            if (iframe) {
              // Hide the iframe
              iframe.style.display = "none";

              // Close the widget
              isVisible = false;

              // Disconnect the observer after the iframe is detected
              observer.disconnect();
            }
          }
        });
      });

### ❓ Question 6:
Mutation was detected but not the iframe
It's inside a div with class: class="skiptranslate"

### ❓ Question 7:
It's detecting the first mutation, it should watch for whenever the Translation Widget is clicked

### ❓ Question 8:
Is there a way to not Translate my Name
I have my name as an element of the Header, I'd like to keep it as it is

### ❓ Question 9:
Just fix the icon, it's a little transparent

### ❓ Question 10:
The icon file has transparency

### ❓ Question 11:
set styles for id="goog-gt-tt"
max-width: 90vh
padding: 2em

And don't show it when the click was on an anchor tag

### ❓ Question 12:
ReferenceError: document is not defined

### ❓ Question 13:
Also hide the element with id=  #goog-gt-tt 

 const skiptranslateDiv =
                  document.querySelector(".skiptranslate");
                if (skiptranslateDiv) {
                  const iframe =
                    skiptranslateDiv.querySelector(
                      "iframe"
                    );
                  if (iframe) {
                    // Hide the iframe
                    iframe.style.display = "none";

                    // Close the widget
                    isVisible = false;
                  }
                }

### ❓ Question 14:
It's not hiding in the sidebar

### ❓ Question 15:
isnt it possible to pass some property to the Translate object to set none to goog-gt-tt elements?

### ❓ Question 16:
Refactor:
I have three features that are very similar
Floating button that opens a modal with content on it 
SocialMedia.Svelte
TranslateButton.Svelte
ReadAloud.Svelte

Based on the TranslateButton.Svelte
Produce a Floating Button Component and a Modal Component that can receive a Component to render

### ❓ Question 17:
*(truncated)*

Improve Modal.svelte and FloatingButton.svelte
Also add this when needed
 on:keypress={onClose}
    aria-label="modal overlay"
    role="button"
    tabindex="0"

// Toggle share modal visibility
  function toggleShareModal() {
    showShareModal = !showShareModal;
  }

  // Handle clicks outside the modal content
  function handleBackdropClick(event: MouseEvent) {
    if (event.target === event.currentTarget) {
      console.log("Backdrop clicked");
      showShareModal = false;
    }
  }

  // Handle keyboard events (Escape to close modal)
  function handleKeydown(event: KeyboardEvent) {
    if (event.key === "Escape") {
      showShareModal = false; // Close share modal
    }

.floating-share {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 80px;
    right: 20px;
    background: var(--background-color, #000);
    color: var(--text-color, #fff);
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    box-shadow: 0px 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: 0.3s;
    z-index: 1000;
 ... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 18:
The issue "Unexpected input(css-syntax-error)" in Svelte is likely due to the fact that you are trying to insert Svelte syntax ({position.bottom}) directly into a CSS block.

In Svelte, the syntax for inserting dynamic values into CSS is different from the syntax for inserting dynamic values into HTML. In CSS, you can use the :global pseudo-class or the style attribute to insert dynamic values.

### ❓ Question 19:
*(truncated)*

Make the button, Modal and Translate components with the following styles:

  import { onMount } from "svelte";

  let isVisible = false;

  // Initialize Google Translate
  onMount(() => {
    const script = document.createElement("script");
    script.src =
      "//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit";
    document.head.appendChild(script);

    window.googleTranslateElementInit = () => {
      new google.translate.TranslateElement(
        { pageLanguage: "auto" },
        "google_translate_element"
      );

      // Start observing the widget's container
      const translateElement = document.getElementById(
        "google_translate_element"
      );
      if (translateElement) {
        // Set up MutationObserver
        const observer = new MutationObserver(
          (mutations) => {
            mutations.forEach((mutation) => {
              // Check if the widget's iframe is added or modified
              if (
                mutation... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 20:
Implement somthing similar to the Translate.svelte:

{#if showShareModal && showIcons}

        {#each Object.entries(shareLinks) as [platform, link]}

            {platform.charAt(0).toUpperCase() +
              platform.slice(1)}

        {/each}

{/if}

### ❓ Question 21:
Implement somthing similar to the Translate.svelte:
as so to use these functions:

// Handle clicks outside the modal content
  function handleBackdropClick(event: MouseEvent) {
    if (event.target === event.currentTarget) {
      console.log("Backdrop clicked");
      showShareModal = false;
    }
  }

  // Handle keyboard events (Escape to close modal)
  function handleKeydown(event: KeyboardEvent) {
    if (event.key === "Escape") {
      showShareModal = false; // Close share modal
    }
  }

{#if showShareModal && showIcons}

        {#each Object.entries(shareLinks) as [platform, link]}

            {platform.charAt(0).toUpperCase() +
              platform.slice(1)}

        {/each}

{/if}

### ❓ Question 22:
How to hide the google translate element if there's a click outside of it?

## Transform Blog into Card Stack Component (2025-03-08)

### ❓ Question 1:
I want to transform this rendering blog post into rendering a stack of cards:

a list of cards 
Each card should get a text ending by a period. 
Render a list of cards slightly on top of each other
Make sure all cards can be translated by the TranslateButton
Below the card a button to show the next card

Create a card svelte component that works on both light and dark mode
Implement for the card: clicking in each word: show its translation and read it aloud

Blog Component

  import "./prism-night-owl.css";
  import type { PageData } from "./$types";
  import CopyCodeInjector from "$lib/components/CopyCodeInjector.svelte";
  import PostHeader from "$lib/components/PostHeader.svelte";
  import SocialMedia from "$lib/components/SocialMedia.svelte";

  export let data: PageData;
  let urlBase = "zayabarrini.vercel.app";

  const { metadata, post: Post, pathname } = data;

### ❓ Question 2:
The content of the cards is the content of the MD sliced into sentences
I also have a Translate Floating Button that translate the whole Page

### ❓ Question 3:
The issue "Parsing error: Unexpected token" in LANGUAGE_SVELTE is likely due to the fact that the translatedText variable is being used outside of the script block.

In Svelte, variables declared in the script block are not automatically available in the HTML template. To fix this issue, you need to move the line {translatedText && {translatedText}} inside the script block or use a reactive statement to make the variable available in the template.

However, in this case, it seems like you want to conditionally render the div element based on the value of translatedText. You can achieve this by moving the line inside the div element with the class card-stack.

### ❓ Question 4:
There's complains about this:
    top: {index * 10}px;

### ❓ Question 5:
Also here: 
    transform: translateY({isActive ? 0 : 20}px);
    opacity: {isActive ? 1 : 0.5};
    z-index: {isActive ? 1 : 0};

### ❓ Question 6:
Error:  is not a valid SSR component. You may need to review your build config to ensure that dependencies are compiled, rather than imported as pre-compiled modules. Otherwise you may need to fix a .

### ❓ Question 7:
I'm using the content from MD to render as a card list, 

$: if (Post) {
    markdownContent = Post.render().html; // Assuming Post.render() returns the HTML content
    cards = sliceContentIntoSentences(markdownContent);
  }
  let cards: string[] = [];

So it really wont work with SSR

### ❓ Question 8:
*(code removed)*

I'm using SvelteKit 

Fix this: 
//+page.ts
import type { MarkdownPost } from "../../../../types";
import type { PageLoad } from "./$types";

export const load: PageLoad = async ({ params }) => {
  const slug = params.slug;

  const markdownPost: MarkdownPost = await import(
    [code]
  );

  return {
    metadata: markdownPost.metadata,
    post: markdownPost.default,
    slug
  };
};

### ❓ Question 9:
*(code removed)*

I'm using SvelteKit 

Fix this to Preprocess Markdown in load Function and return the list of cards
//+page.ts
import type { MarkdownPost } from "../../../../types";
import type { PageLoad } from "./$types";

export const load: PageLoad = async ({ params }) => {
  const slug = params.slug;

  const markdownPost: MarkdownPost = await import(
    [code]
  );

  return {
    metadata: markdownPost.metadata,
    post: markdownPost.default,
    slug
  };
};

### ❓ Question 10:
*(code removed)*

I'm using SvelteKit 

Fix this to Preprocess Markdown in load Function and return the list of cards and to work with SSR
//+page.ts
import type { MarkdownPost } from "../../../../types";
import type { PageLoad } from "./$types";

export const load: PageLoad = async ({ params }) => {
  const slug = params.slug;

  const markdownPost: MarkdownPost = await import(
    [code]
  );

 return {
    post,
    cards, // Pass the preprocessed cards as a prop
  };

### ❓ Question 11:
Since there's html markers, filter by  or headers too
const sliceContentIntoSentences = (
  content: string
): string[] => {
  // Split by periods, question marks, or exclamation marks, preserving the delimiter
  return content
    .split(/(? sentence.trim() !== "");
};

### ❓ Question 12:
export type MarkdownPost = {
  metadata: {
    title: string;
    imgUrl: string;
    youtubeId?: string;
    publishedAt: string;
    summary: string;
  };
  default: ComponentType;
};

const content = markdownPost.default.render().html; // Assuming render() returns HTML

TypeError: markdownPost.default.render is not a function

### ❓ Question 13:
Failed to load post

### ❓ Question 14:
+page.ts:56 Error loading post: Error: marked(): input parameter is of type [object Function], string expected

### ❓ Question 15:
['', '', 'title: &quot;Music - Favorite Artists&quot;\nimgUrl…ary: &quot;The Neighbourhood, Zayn and more&quot;', '', '']

Split only for paragraphs, h1, and h2

const sliceContentIntoSentences = (
  content: string
): string[] => {
  const sentences: string[] = [];
  const parts = content.split(/(]+>)/);

  parts.forEach((part) => {
    if (part.startsWith("")) {
      sentences.push(part);
    } else {
      const partSentences = part
        .split(/(? sentence.trim() !== "");
      sentences.push(...partSentences);
    }
  });

  return sentences;
};

### ❓ Question 16:
How does this work? 
  const parts = content.split(/(]+>)/);

I dont want to save html tags, I want the content inside of it split into         .split(/(?', '', 'title: &quot;Conversing&quot;\nimgUrl: &quot;/css/i…rb Conjugation, Psychoanalysis, Cinema, etc&quot;', '', '']0: ""1: ""2: "title: &quot;Conversing&quot;\nimgUrl: &quot;/css/img/Bing/bing104.png&quot;\nyoutubeId: &quot;&quot;\npublishedAt: &quot;2025-02-24&quot;\nsummary: &quot;Grammar, Pronunciation, Verb Conjugation, Psychoanalysis, Cinema, etc&quot;"3: ""4: ""length: 5[[Prototype]]: Array(0)

const sliceContentIntoSentences = (
  content: string
): string[] => {
  const sentences: string[] = [];
  const parts = content.split(/(]+>)/);

  parts.forEach((part) => {
    if (
      part.startsWith("") &&
      part.length > 7
    ) {
      sentences.push(part);
    } else {
      const partSentences = part
        .split(/(? sentence.trim() !== "");
      sentences.push(...partSentences);
    }
  });

  return sentences;
};

### ❓ Question 17:
Before returning the list of cards, remove the first 5, 
Shuffle and return 25 cards max

return {
      post: markdownPost.metadata, // Return post metadata
      cards: cards.slice(5, 30) // Return the list of sentences (cards)
    };

### ❓ Question 18:
Add split by \n
const sentences = textContent
    .split(/(? sentence.trim() !== ""); // Remove empty sentences

### ❓ Question 19:
replace this &#39

"Ich hab&#39; geschwor&#39;n, ich bin da, jede Nacht schlaf&#39; ich mit dir ein"

## Responsive Search Input with Modal Functionality (2025-02-24)

### ❓ Question 1:
Beautiful  search input 20% width desktop, mobile: Search Icon + open modal for search

✅ User types a query and submits
✅ Redirects to /list?query=SearchInput
✅ Works on mobile and desktop
✔ "×" close button is positioned at the end of the search input
✔ Keeps the modal accessible (aria-label for screen readers)
✔ Maintains a clean UI with smooth styling
✔ Clears searchQuery on close & prevents invalid searches
✅ Prevents modal from closing when clicking "Search"
✅ Full keyboard support (Escape to close, Enter to search)

### ❓ Question 2:
Do it as a svelte component
SearchInput.svelte

### ❓ Question 3:
Make it for the desktop the same behavior as the mobile: Search Icon + Modal when clicked

### ❓ Question 4:
close the modal with any click outside the Search Form

### ❓ Question 5:
*(code removed, truncated)*

If let floating = true, and showIcon =  true, show the icons in a mini modal
Also add the option to Copy the link to clipboard Icon

  import { onMount } from "svelte";

  export let title: string;
  export let url: string;
  export let image: string;
  export let floating: boolean = true; // Enable floating button
  export let showIcons = true;

  // Encode URL and title
  const encodedTitle = encodeURIComponent(title);
  const encodedUrl = encodeURIComponent(url);

  // Social Media Share Links
  const shareLinks = {
    // instagram: [code],
    linkedin: [code],
    facebook: [code],
    whatsapp: [code],
    telegram: [code],
    twitter: [code]
  };

  // Ensure correct link preview
  onMount(() => {
    const metaImage = document.querySelector(
      "meta[property='og:image']"
    );
    if (!metaImage) {
      const metaTag = document.createElement("meta");
      metaTag.setAttribute("property", "og:image");
      metaTag.setAttribute("content", image);
      document.head.app... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 6:
This is a new Component called SocialMedia.svelte

### ❓ Question 7:
Fix it to make it work with both darkMode and Light mode

### ❓ Question 8:
give me just a expression to filter the icons to white when in dark mode

### ❓ Question 9:
It's not being defined:
Where should I place it?
:global(:root) {
    --background-color: #{darkMode ? "#333": "#000"};
    --text-color: #{darkMode ? "#fff": "#000"};
    --hover-background-color: #{darkMode ? "#555": "#333"};
    --hover-text-color: #{darkMode ? "#1e90ff": "#007bff"};
    --modal-background: #{darkMode ? "#444": "#fff"};
    --icon-filter: #{darkMode ? "invert(1)": "none"};
  }

### ❓ Question 10:
Parsing error: You can only have one top-level  tag per componenteslint

### ❓ Question 11:
dark:border-gray-700
I was using classes like this
Can I define these global variables on the css file to use for Icons and modals across all components?

### ❓ Question 12:
Adapt this to update the new variables:

  import { darkmode } from "$lib/stores/darkmode";
  import { slide } from "svelte/transition";
  import MoonIcon from "./svg/MoonIcon.svelte";
  import SunIcon from "./svg/SunIcon.svelte";

  let inTransition = {
    duration: 400,
    delay: 500
  };

  let outTransition = {
    duration: 400
  };

  function toggleDarkmode() {
    if ($darkmode) {
      $darkmode = false;
      document.documentElement.classList.remove("dark");
      localStorage.setItem("theme", "light");
    } else {
      $darkmode = true;
      document.documentElement.classList.add("dark");
      localStorage.setItem("theme", "dark");
    }
  }

  {#if $darkmode}

  {:else}

  {/if}

### ❓ Question 13:
*(code removed)*

Table with information about Share the Image, title, summary, clickable Link based on Android and Iphone

  const shareLinks = {
    linkedin: [code],
    facebook: [code],
    whatsapp: [code],
    telegram: [code],
    twitter: [code]
  };

### ❓ Question 14:
How can I test for Iphone?

### ❓ Question 15:
Clicking outside the modal is not closing it 
I replaced divs with button because there are complaints about the divs

{#if showShareModal && showIcons}

      {#each Object.entries(shareLinks) as [platform, link]}

          {platform.charAt(0).toUpperCase() +
            platform.slice(1)}

      {/each}

        Copy

{/if}

### ❓ Question 16:
A11y: visible, non-interactive elements with an on:click event must be accompanied by a keyboard event handler.

{#if showShareModal && showIcons}

        {#each Object.entries(shareLinks) as [platform, link]}

            {platform.charAt(0).toUpperCase() +
              platform.slice(1)}

        {/each}

          Copy Link

{/if}

### ❓ Question 17:
*(code removed)*

What are other params that can be set for each social
const shareLinks = {
    linkedin: [code],
    facebook: [code],
    whatsapp: [code],
    telegram: [code],
    twitter: [code],
  };

### ❓ Question 18:
I'm importing bootstrap on the +layout.ts
as a script

and as a module
but it's not being applied to tables rendered on the md file

 preprocess: [
    vitePreprocess(),
    mdsvex({
      extensions: ['.svx', '.md'],
      // remarkPlugins: [remarkParse, remarkMath, remarkRehype],
      // rehypePlugins: [rehypeKatex, rehypeStringify, rehypeKatexSvelte]
      remarkPlugins: [remarkMath],
      rehypePlugins: [
        rehypeAddAltText,
        [
          rehypeMathjax,
          {
            // Optional: Configure MathJax settings here
            tex: {
              inlineMath: [['$', '$']],
              displayMath: [['$$', '$$']],
            },
          },
        ],
      ],
    })

### ❓ Question 19:
how do I know if the classes are being applied:
Bootstrap seems to be fine, but the table is not beautiful

### ❓ Question 20:
It's not being loaded, the afterUpdate rendered the console logs but didn't load the bootstrap

### ❓ Question 21:
I'm also using tailwind:

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

Bootstrap are being loaded but it may be conflicting with tailwind
The dynamic application of styles worked but they do not change with darkmode

### ❓ Question 9:
Adicione uma mensagem de confirmação após a instalação em Inglês
Use o ícone SVG, posicione o botão do lado direito da página, acima dos demais elementos da página

Talvez right: 10vh
Top: 10vh

### ❓ Question 10:
Make this message last 5 seconds
{#if installed}
  App instalado com sucesso! 🎉
{/if}
 z-index: 1005;
    top: 10vh;
    right: 1vw;
    position: fixed;

### ❓ Question 11:
The button is not showing correctly on localhost, but it's showing in the deployment:

  onMount(() => {
    if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
      window.addEventListener(
        "beforeinstallprompt",
        (event) => {
          event.preventDefault();
          deferredPrompt = event;
          showButton = true;
        }
      );
    }
  });

### ❓ Question 12:
The button is not showing  on localhost on the browser which is correct, but it's showing in the deployment, which is wrong:

  onMount(() => {
    if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
      window.addEventListener(
        "beforeinstallprompt",
        (event) => {
          event.preventDefault();
          deferredPrompt = event;
          showButton = true;
        }
      );
    }
  });

### ❓ Question 13:
*(truncated)*

I think showButton should be reactive because if the user refuses to install then the button should disappear

 let deferredPrompt;
  let showButton = false;
  let installed = false;

  onMount(() => {
    if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
      window.addEventListener(
        "beforeinstallprompt",
        (event) => {
          event.preventDefault();
          deferredPrompt = event;
          showButton = true;
        }
      );
    }
  });

  function installPWA() {
    if (deferredPrompt) {
      deferredPrompt.prompt();
      deferredPrompt.userChoice.then((choice) => {
        if (choice.outcome === "accepted") {
          console.log("Usuário instalou o PWA");
          installed = true;
          // setTimeout(() => {
          //   const notification =
          //     document.querySelector(".notification");
          //   notification.classList.add("fade-out");
          //   setTimeout(() => (installed = false), 500); // Remove após a animação
          // }, 4500); ... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 14:
When I click Cancel when prompted to install on the deployment, it doesn't remove the button, it is still showing

## Display Command Time in ZSH Prompt (2025-03-19)

### ❓ Question 1:
I'm using ZSH_THEME="pixegami-agnoster"
on terminal, is there an option to display inline the time that the command was issued?

### ❓ Question 2:
I added before the theme and it got weird:
     main !3 ?1  %{%K{008}%}%{%F{010}%} %(!.%{%F{yellow}%}.)%n

What I have with prompt
# Enable Powerlevel10k instant prompt.
# Should stay close to the top of ~/.zshrc.
if [[ -r "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/p10k-instant-prompt-${(%):-%n}.zsh" ]]; then
  source "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/p10k-instant-prompt-${(%):-%n}.zsh"
fi

# Load Powerlevel10k theme.
if [[ -d ~/powerlevel10k ]]; then
  source ~/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme
fi

# Customize prompt.
[[ ! -f ~/.p10k.zsh ]] || source ~/.p10k.zsh

### ❓ Question 3:
I'm doing this because there's no POWERLEVEL9K_LEFT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS on my file:
Time is showing, but so is this weird string:   21:35:19    main !3 ?1  %{%K{008}%}%{%F{010}%} %(!.%{%F{yellow}%}.)%nsource ~/.zshrc

# Enable Powerlevel10k instant prompt.
# Should stay close to the top of ~/.zshrc.
if [[ -r "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/p10k-instant-prompt-${(%):-%n}.zsh" ]]; then
  source "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/p10k-instant-prompt-${(%):-%n}.zsh"
fi

# Load Powerlevel10k theme.
if [[ -d ~/powerlevel10k ]]; then
  source ~/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme
fi

# Customize prompt.
[[ ! -f ~/.p10k.zsh ]] || source ~/.p10k.zsh

typeset -g POWERLEVEL9K_LEFT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS=(
  time
  dir
  vcs
)

# typeset -g POWERLEVEL9K_TIME_FORMAT='%D{%H:%M:%S}'

### ❓ Question 4:
When a command is running, these variables time
  dir
  vcs 
disappear
I want to keep seeing them while a command is processing

## What could MoonReader be possibl (2025-03-24)

### ❓ Question 1:
What could MoonReader be possible ignoring for the rt tags to be intersecting with each other in arabic and hindi text where the font-size used for the epub to display the text are relatively small
transliteration text is bigger than the original text 
It prioritize ruby tags, doesn't respect margins for rt tags

MoonReader seems to consider:
Disable CSS styles

Disable Font styles (bold/italic/underline)

Disable Font sizes (small/large/em)

Disable Colors (text, background color)

Disable Alignment (left/center/right)

Disable Alignment (justify)

Disable Indent (px/pt/em/in)

Disable Paragraph margin/padding

Disable others (table, border, float, etc.)

Import HtmlTransliteration
Run in a folder with epubs and transliterate
The name of the epub contains the language: First word up to "-" : Language-Name-of-the-Book.epub
Language = Language.smallcase

# Rename epub to zip, Extract files, Process files, Zip again, Rename to .epub

# cd Folder/EPUB/text

# Transliterate all html files in the folder

# Add styles, I need to include styles based on the language:
# Set CSS file based on language
    if language == "japanese" or language == "chinese":
        css_file = "/home/zaya/Documents/Gitrepos/Linktrees/Business/Dev/Py/Transliteration/styles-ch-jp.css"

    cover_image = f"/home/zaya/Downloads/Zayas/zayaweb/s... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 2:
How to export, import HtmlTransliteration.py
Should receive  as arguments: 
input_folder = '/path/to/html/files'  # Update this path to your folder containing HTML files
target_language = 'japanese'

### ❓ Question 3:
Implement def add_metadata_and_cover
Change: 

"cover"
Add website

add_metadata_and_cover(epub_folder, base_name):
    random_number = random.randint(1, 211)
    cover_image = f"/home/zaya/Downloads/Zayas/zayaweb/static/css/img/Bing/bing{random_number}.png"

        "author": "Zaya Barrini",
        "website": "https://zayabarrini.vercel.app/",
    }
    # Add metadata and cover image to the EPUB folder
    # This is a placeholder for actual implementation
    # You would typically modify the OPF file in the EPUB to include metadata and cover image
    pass

### ❓ Question 4:
I'm gonna put add_metadata_and_cover.py as new file
Change it to also receive the language, date dynamically set (TodaysDate)

### ❓ Question 5:
Is it creating the OEBPS folder, or is it assuming there will be a folder with this name?
    text_folder = os.path.join(extract_to, 'OEBPS', 'Text')

        style_tag = soup.new_tag('style')
        style_tag.string = css_content
        soup.head.append(style_tag)

### ❓ Question 27:

I'm deployment a ZayasLanguage project using SvelteKit and vercel
I implemented in python a Transliteration function (webTransliteration.py) that import a series of libraries and some of them I had to modify locally so it'd work as I expected
I want to deploy this webTransliteration.py and add some functionality into it (Input form for translation and Transliteration of the content, instead of using plain json)
Is it better to deploy a new python project in Vercel/other or to Implement in ZayasLanguage the transliteration page, import the local py functions?

### ❓ Question 11:
How does server.py works?

## Python App on Phone, Termux (2025-03-31)

### ❓ Question 1:
*(truncated)*

Add input form, read string from input form after submission instead of getting the content from the json, translate it into a list of languages:
[de, it, fr, ru, zh-ch, jp, hi, ar, ko, en, es ]
for languages that need transliteration: do transliteration
Display the list of:
Translatation + Transliteration when needed

translationFunctions.py:
@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def translate_text(text, target_language):
    """Translate text to target language using Google Translate with caching."""
    if not text.strip():
        return text

    try:
        translated = GoogleTranslator(source='auto', target=LANGUAGE_CODE_MAP[target_language]).translate(text)
        return translated if translated else text

    'hindi': 'hi',
    'arabic': 'ar',
    'korean': 'ko',
} to include [de, it, fr, ru, zh-ch, jp, hi, ar, ko, en, es ]

### ❓ Question 3:
update this to pass the full language name small case for the transliterate, and add_furigana functions:

def process_translation(text, language_code):
    """Translate text and apply transliteration if needed."""
    translated = translate_text(text, language_code)

    transliterated = None
    if language_code in TRANSLITERATION_LANGUAGES:
        transliterated = transliterate(translated, language_code)
        if transliterated:
            transliterated = add_furigana(translated, transliterated, language_code)

    return {
        'language': next((lang['name'] for lang in LANGUAGES if lang['code'] == language_code), language_code),
        'translation': translated,
        'transliteration': transliterated
    }

Nella traduzione slovena, il secondo verso è reso con «Perché sono quello che sono?». Benché la licenza poetica sia qui addirittura eccessiva, l’essenza della situazione è ben trasmessa: privata&nbsp;dei suoi titoli simbolici, l’identità di Riccardo si scioglie come un&nbsp;pupazzo di neve al sole.

  Per l’isterico, il problema è come distinguere ciò che egli stesso è (il suo vero desiderio) da quanto altri vedono o desiderano in lui.&nbsp;Questo ci conduce a un’altra formula lacaniana, «il desiderio dell’uomo è il desiderio dell’altro». Per Lacan, l’impasse fondamentale del desiderio umano è che esso coincide con il desiderio dell’altro inteso nel senso di genitivo sia soggettivo che oggettivo: desiderio per l’altro, desiderio di essere desiderato dall’altro e, soprattutto, desiderio per quanto l’altro desidera. Invidia e risentimento sono, come sant’Agostino ben sapeva, una componente costitutiva del desiderio umano;... [truncated]

Let's add an variable that indicates if I want to keep to remove its immediately sibling or itself:
Sometimes, I want to remove the original language of the ebook, or the Translated language that it got:
I don't think we should exclude english: and not(@lang="en"))
Just check for the @lang

# Find all translated elements
    translations = root.xpath('//*[@dir="auto" or (@lang and not(@lang="en"))]')

    # For each translation, remove its immediate previous sibling if it exists

    return zip_name

... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 2:
I'd like to add a bigger font for arabic text, if the translation language is arabic, the font-size should be bigger

### ❓ Question 3:
Change the main to process all srt files in a folder, apply the same target_languages:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_file = "/home/zaya/Documents/Gitrepos/cinema/Subtitles/test.srt"
    target_languages = ["de", "zh-ch"]    
    process_multilingual_srt(input_file, target_languages, enable_transliteration=True)

### ❓ Question 4:
Let's use create style to optionally apply colors for all languages, and a bigger font-size for arabic:
Based on the LANGUAGE_CODE_MAP = {
    'de': 'de',        # German
    'it': 'it',        # Italian
    'fr': 'fr',        # French
    'ru': 'ru',        # Russian
    'zh-ch': 'zh-CN',  # Chinese (Simplified)
    'jp': 'ja',        # Japanese
    'hi': 'hi',        # Hindi
    'ar': 'ar',        # Arabic
    'ko': 'ko',        # Korean
    'en': 'en',        # English
    'es': 'es',        # Spanish
}, let's create an object for colors, for each language:
Use: FFADAD, FFD6A5, FDFFB6, CAFFBF, 9BF6FF, A0C4FF, BDB2FF, FFC6FF, fae1dd, fcd5ce, caffbf

### ❓ Question 5:

## Donut Tutorial Convert to Py blender (2025-04-09)

### ❓ Question 1:
Structure this:
https://github.com/george-hawkins/blender-donut-notebook

### ❓ Question 2:
*(truncated)*

Can you add the icing with sprinkles over the Klein bottle
There are direction here to how to do it: https://github.com/george-hawkins/blender-donut-notebook
Create a function called Apply Icing with sprinkles to an object, and use it on the Klein Bottle 

def create_klein_bottle():
    """Create an approximation of a Klein bottle using a torus."""
    try:
        print("Creating torus as base for Klein bottle...")

        # Path to your 3D object file (replace with your actual path)
        file_path = "/home/zaya/Documents/Gitrepos/kleinsfantasy/models/klein.blend"        

        # Specify the name of the object to link
        object_name = "Circle.002"  # Replace with the actual name of your object in the .blend file

        # Load the .blend file
        with bpy.data.libraries.load(file_path, link=False) as (data_from, data_to):
            if object_name in data_from.objects:
                data_to.objects = [object_name]

        # Link the object to the current scene
   ... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 3:
*(code removed, truncated)*

Learn this and fix the Icing_with_sprinkles function:
The Torus mentioned it was the base for the Donut, here we want to apply the icing with sprinkles to whatever object:

Double-click "Torus" here and rename it to "Donut" and double-click "Torus.001" and rename it to "Icing".

Note you can also just select the particular item in the main view and press [code] to rename it.

**Important:** I managed to mess up this duplication step in various different ways, e.g. separating the top of the donut mesh rather than duplicating and then separating the duplicated mesh or dragging the mesh after duplicating and getting into a confused state or duplicating twice without realizing. It was only when later steps didn't pan out as expected, e.g. an unexpected additional surface becoming clear, that it became obvious that I hadn't completed this step completely correctly.

If you [code] back into _Object Mode_, it's interesting to see how the bottom edge of the icing "clings" closer to the mesh th... [truncated]

## Summary: Blender Donut Tutorial Notebook (2025-04-10)

### ❓ Question 1:
*(code removed, truncated)*

Resume this: be concise
Blender donut tutorial notebook
===============================

This is the notebook I wrote while following Blender Guru's [Blender Beginner Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEq0u2MzVgAaHEBt--xLB6U). Along with lots of notes taken straight from the videos, it includes notes on the various things that I got confused about and how I resolved those issues.

There are no affiliate links in this notebook and all credit goes to Andrew Price (aka Blender Guru). This notebook is not meant to be standalone - it's my notes to go with the videos.

If you're interested in a quick visual summary of the process covered here see [[code]](journey.md).

To get the latest version of Blender go to the Blender [download page](https://www.blender.org/download/).

I used Blender version 2.92 while the videos use Blender 2.8 (see [here](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/) for the release history) so things look a little different b... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 2:
*(code removed, truncated)*

Now this:
![img.png](natural-edge-icing.png)

Once the edge of the icing is a little bit more natural, it's time to add more dramatic dribbles.

Go back to smooth for _Proportional Editing_ and now at points along the edge that are already hanging down a little, select two adjacent vertices (either shift-click them or drag a bounding box to select both). Press [code] to extrude and drag the two points - you'll drag out two new points from the selected points (compare this with what happens if you turn off _Proportional Editing_ and use [code] instead - which will just drag around the existing points).

![img.png](extrude.png)

If you [code] to _Object Mode_, these dribbles look far more jaggy than the nice smooth dribbles in the video.

![img.png](dribble-jaggy.png)

I resolved this by going to the _Subdivision_ modifier and increasing the _Levels Viewport_ from 1 to 2:

![img.png](dribble-smooth.png)

TODO: when Andrew introduced _Subdivision_, he said 1 would be fine, maybe he just m... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 3:
*(code removed, truncated)*

Now this: 
### Material

To finish off this part of the tutorial, select the plane, go to the _Material Properties_:

![img.png](material-properties.png)

Click _New_ and then a whole array of settings appear, just go to _Base Color_ and click its color area (currently grey) and enter e.g. 0.6, 0.8 and 0.9 (for the H, S and V values respectively) for a light blue color.

Now generate a render (once you've got the camera view you want) with [code], with some color in the scene, it's interesting to see how the blue of the plane also affects the color of the donut:

![render 2](render-02.png)

Level 1, Part 7 - materials
---------------------------

Note: at this point things start getting frustratingly slow if you don't have a good graphics card - I upgraded to a system with an RTX 2060 (it required a system upgrade as the power supply on my old system could provide a total of 300W whereas the RTX 2060 can draw up to 250W on its own - in contrast to an older card like the GTX 1050 Ti tha...

### ❓ Question 4:
*(code removed, truncated)*

Now this: Blender donut tutorial notebook - level 2
=========================================

This carries on my notebook for the [Blender donut tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEq0u2MzVgAaHEBt--xLB6U). There first part of the notebook is [here](README.md) and covers level 1. This part covers level 2.

Level 2, Part 1 - particles
---------------------------

Return to the _Layout_ workspace if you're still in _Compositing_ and to the simple _Solid_ viewport shading rather than _Rendered_.

### Organize your Outliner

The _Scene Collection_ (upper-right corner) is actually part of the _Editor Type_ called _Outliner_. We already created the "Archive" collection there so that we could exclude it from the view layer. So let's do the same for everything else and clean up the _Outliner_ to make everything more manageable:

* Select both donut and icing, add press [code] (for move) and add a _New Collection_ that's also called "Donut" - this seems a bit ... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 5:
*(code removed, truncated)*

Now this: 
### Adding balls as an additional sprinkle type

As noted before the 3D cursor determines where new objects are added, so press [code] and move it out to the left of the sprinkles (you can return it, later, to its default location, with [code]).

Then [code] and add a new _UV Sphere_ (under _Mesh_) - it'll start as absolutely massive relative to the existing sprinkles, so in the _Add UV Sphere_ operator panel change _Segments_ to 16, _Rings_ to 8 and _Radius_ to 4mm.

Select it, right-click and select _Shade Smooth_, then [code] and move it to where you want it relative to the other sprinkles.

Note: the existing sprinkles all share a common material, i.e. it's not simply duplicated with them. If you e.g. adjust the roughness for one then it affects all of them. The material isn't an attribute of an object - the material is a thing in its own right. When duplicating objects, you don't duplicate the material you simply duplicate a reference to it.

**Update:** if you have an ... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 6:
*(truncated)*

Last one:
### Darkening the donut

We've used the brush and texture to introduce a lighter colored belt around the donut. Now to use the texture to darken up and get rid of the flatness of the color of the rest of the donut.

To do this, increase the brush size a little, make sure white is the primary color and change it to black (V value of 0). If you paint on the donut now - you'll paint a cloudy black color which isn't what we want. Instead, change the brush _Blend_ type from _Mix_ to _Overlay_ - this, instead of painting over the existing color, will reduce its brightness, i.e. make it darker (essentially adjust the V value of the existing color).

It was at this point that I noticed something that I hadn't spotted when painting the white belt. An odd seam corresponding to the edge of the image:

![img.png](bad-seam.png)

It was here that I had to learn all about UV unwrapping (the cookbook steps covered above).

Eventually, I got everything sorted out and redid the painting:

### ❓ Question 12:
Let's create a new file to add the metadata for each combined file, so we can use it on both common movies, and on TV Series

Metadata:

### ❓ Question 13:
Give me a add_metadata.py just run in a folder of md files and  add metadata to each of them, use the filename and cover-image

def generate_metadata(title, file_type="subtitles"):
    """Generate YAML metadata block with random cover image"""
    random_num = random.randint(1, 214)
    metadata = {

### ❓ Question 14:
*(truncated)*

Use this to force subtitles into a single line 
(.*)\n+(?!-)(.*) : Some subtitles are split in several lines and this regex forces them into a single line. For this filter to work, you must also put $1 $2 in the "Subtitle regex filter text replacement" field.
NB: When using this regex pattern in combination with other patterns (using the | operator, see below), place this pattern at the end. This ensures that all other regex transformations are applied first, and then the results are finally combined into a single line.

#!/bin/bash

# Directory where the files are located
directory="/home/zaya/Downloads/Workspace/Subtitles/TVSeries2"

# Loop over each file in the directory
for file in "$directory"/*; do
    # Skip if not a regular file
    if [[ ! -f "$file" ]]; then

### ❓ Question 15:
before removing timestamps, let's have only one line for each timestamp:

input: 2
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,519
WOMAN: The voice you hear
is not my speaking voice,

output: 2
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,519
WOMAN: The voice you hear is not my speaking voice,

### ❓ Question 1:
apply a python regex to a srt file:
Regex: 
" Join lines if the next line starts with a letter, small or capital  
   similar to: %s/\n\(\l\)/ \1/g

### ❓ Question 2:
Actually, I want to join lines keeping only one line for each timestamp:
1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,599
(DARK ORCHESTRAL MUSIC)

2
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,519

### ❓ Question 2:
Are there any unnecessary/repetitive translations or transliterations in this process?
It should not be long for 4, or 5 files

### ❓ Question 3:
generate_combination_output is not defined, did you mean something else, if not, implement it

### ❓ Question 4:
Give me just the fix: 
For the last timestamp, it's missing a newline separation between original and translation:

make this work with both language code maps, full and short:  
if TARGET_PATTERNS.get(target_language).search(line):
            output_lines_v3.append(line)

TARGET_PATTERNS = {
    'chinese': re.compile(r'[\u4e00-\u9fff]'),
    'russian': re.compile(r'[\u0400-\u04FF]'),
    'hindi': re.compile(r'[\u0900-\u097F]'),
    'japanese': re.compile(r'[\u3040-\u30FF\u4E00-\u9FFF]'),

## Exploring Fluid Gender Identity and Expression (2025-04-23)

### ❓ Question 1:
gender identities 
two spirits: RSI - female fantasies, female nouns, base male image
pronouns: female
female fantasies: healing, mother, grandmother, wife, artistic and colorful 
image: base is male, usage of art to incorporate colours
add female elements to image: long, colorful hair is possible as a wig, dresses and underwear are possible, but male clothes are also possible 
women identities: powerful, bodybuilders, athletes, psychoanalysts, artistic colorful, dancers, smart, art directors, cinema directors
there's love towards male elements in my body, I have the most fun with female performance, but also get tired of performing
possible surgeries: hair transplant, hair micropigmentation, skin enhancers in the future
base relaxed image for just enjoying the world, camping, nature, hiking, beaches, sex, easy travel

### ❓ Question 2:
tell me more about two spirits/non-binary/gender fluid 
name usage, pronouns

### ❓ Question 3:
I use both Zaya Barrini and Talles de Oliveira Faria
my mother is more hippie-like, nature , colors,

father is outside-paranoid, rock-philosophy-weed, law-power critic, stay at home, away and protected from the world

### ❓ Question 4:

### ❓ Question 6:
can we just modify the import on the modified libraries:

modified_kakasi:
from .kanji import JConv
from .properties import Ch
from .scripts import A2, H2, IConv, K2, Sym2

modified_russian:
from .base import registry
from .conf import get_setting
from .discover import autodiscover
from .exceptions import (
    LanguageCodeError,
    LanguageDetectionError,
    LanguagePackNotFound,
)

### ❓ Question 7:
exclude_chars from hindi, arabic and russian transliteration
add_furigana:
elif language in ["hindi", "arabic", "russian"]:
        segmented_words = text.split()
        for word in segmented_words:
            if trans_index {word}{translit}")
            else:
                furigana_text.append(f"{word}")
        return ' '.join(furigana_text)

Look what it did:
ТTestirovanieеTestirovanieсTestirovanieтTestirovanieиTestirovanieрTestirovanieоTestirovanieвTestirovanieаTestirovanieнTestirovanieиTestirovanieеTestirovanieчche

we're processing word here
we should exclude_chars from the transliteration: translit.removeChars in exclude_chars, right?

## Creating EPUB with Ruby Annotations Workflow (2025-04-28)

### ❓ Question 1:
I want to create an ebook of word lists/sentences with {translated}{word} 
The process I'm doing is: to avoid translation limits and since this is supposed to be small, I'm using https://translate.google.com/ to get the translations I need.
I place them on a md file, convert it to epub using pandoc
english version, md, epub
target_language version, md, epub
To do the juxtaposition into ruby, rt tags, considering only paragraphs, split paragraphs contents by punctuation, then we'd have two list to just merge into the ruby, rt
Does this work?

## Write an md file called RubyTran (2025-04-28)

### ❓ Question 1:
Write an md file called RubyTranslation.md
Read two md files, test-en.md, test-de.md
read line 
if the line starts with #, skip it
split by comma
translated comes from test-de.md, word comes from test-en.md            
translated_words.append(f'{translated}{word}')

It's similar to this, but here we're getting our words from the md files

def translate_word_by_word(text, target_lang):
    words = text.split()
    translated_words = []

    for word in words:
        try:
            # Skip translation if the word is just punctuation or whitespace
            if word.strip() == '':
                translated_words.append(word)
                continue

            translated = GoogleTranslator(source='auto', target=target_lang).translate(word)
            translated_words.append(f'{translated}{word}')
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error translating word '{word}': {str(e)}")
            translated_words.append(f'{word}')

    return ' '.join(translated_words)

### ❓ Question 2:
*(truncated)*

Let's create WordListRubyTranslation.py that
Write an md file called RubyTranslation.md
Read two md files, test-en.md, test-de.md
read line 
if the line starts with #, skip it
split by comma
translated comes from test-de.md, word comes from test-en.md            
translated_words.append(f'{translated}{word}')

It's similar to this, but here we're getting our words from the md files

def translate_word_by_word(text, target_lang):
    words = text.split()
    translated_words = []

    for word in words:
        try:
            # Skip translation if the word is just punctuation or whitespace
            if word.strip() == '':
                translated_words.append(word)
                continue

            translated = GoogleTranslator(source='auto', target=target_lang).translate(word)
            translated_words.append(f'{translated}{word}')
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error translating word '{word}': {str(e)}")
            translated_words.append(f'{word}')

... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 3:
*(truncated)*

Let's create a new file: CsvRT.py
It reads a csv file containing columns en, de, ru, ar, hi and produces a list a epubs associated with each language target: de, ru, ar, hi
I'm gonna use english as the base language in the rt tag
It creates an md file with metadata:

if date is None:
        date = datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
base_name = Dictionary-${language}
    # Define metadata
    random_number = random.randint(1, 211)
    metadata = {
        "title": base_name,
        "author": "Zaya Barrini",
        "website": "https://zayabarrini.vercel.app/",
        "language": language,
        "date": date,
    "image-cover": "/home/zaya/Downloads/Zayas/zayaweb/static/css/img/Bing/bing{random_number}.png"
    }

And content:
for each line of the csv: 
every 10 ruby annotations insert a \n\n double line break - for breathing
for lines starting with #, skip the ruby annotation, but add an extra \n before inserting the line, so that pandoc recognize as a TOC header
# Create ruby a... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 4:
explain the .strip(): row[language].strip()

### ❓ Question 5:
fix the metadata so it can be correctly read by pandoc:
example:
---
title:
  - type: main
    text: Practice German
  - type: subtitle
    text: words
creator:
  - role: author
    text: Zaya Barrini
  - role: editor
    text: Zaya Barrini
cover-image: /home/zaya/Downloads/Zayas/zayaweb/static/css/img/Bing/bing66.png
identifier:
  - scheme: DOI
    text: doi:10.234234.234/33
publisher: My Press
rights: © 2007 John Smith, CC BY-NC
ibooks:
  version: 1.3.4
...

### ❓ Question 6:
I think this is unnecessary: 
if len(translated_words) % 10 > 0:
            md_content.append(', '.join(translated_words[-(len(translated_words)%10:]) + '\n')
Explain it

### ❓ Question 7:
I think this is unnecessary: 
if len(translated_words) % 10 > 0:
            md_content.append(', '.join(translated_words[-(len(translated_words)%10:]) + '\n')

And this is wrong:             '--metadata-file', md_filename,

Explain it

### ❓ Question 8:
*(truncated)*

This is working perfectly:
Add this: for each target_language, create an epub containing only its words without translation
So we'd have a pair for each: de, de-en, ru, ru-en, ar, ar-en

# CsvRT.py
import csv
import random
from datetime import datetime
import subprocess
import os
import uuid

def generate_epubs(csv_file_path, output_dir='output', date=None):
    # Create output directory if it doesn't exist
    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

    if date is None:
        date = datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

    # Read CSV file
    with open(csv_file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
        rows = list(reader)

    # Process each target language
    for language in ['de', 'ru', 'ar', 'hi']:
        base_name = f"Dictionary-{language}"
        random_number = random.randint(1, 211)
        lang_names = {
            'de': 'German',

### ❓ Question 5:
I want it to do the same as for the chinese:
the text contains both english and japanese sentences
it should just ignore the english sentences and transliterate the japanese creating ruby tags
example for the chinese that works correctly with styles:
How could you question God’s existence
你nǐ怎zěn么me能néng质zhì

elif language == "chinese":
        pinyin = get_pinyin_annotations(text)
        return pinyin

### ❓ Question 6:

It had some errors:
Maybe for the Japanese text, we could use this function to only process the tags with japanese translations

### ❓ Question 8:

def merge_subtitle_lines(input_file, output_file=None):
    """Merge subtitle lines and save the modified content with error handling."""
    try:
        # Try different encodings
        encodings = ['utf-8', 'latin-1', 'iso-8859-1', 'cp1252', 'utf-16']
        content = None

        for encoding in encodings:
            try:
                with open(input_file, 'r', encoding=encoding) as f:
                    content = f.read()
                # If we get here, the encoding worked
                break
            except UnicodeDecodeError:
                continue

        if content is None:
            # If none of the encodings worked, fall back to binary with error handling
            with open(input_file, 'rb') as f:
                content = f.read().decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')

        # Split into individual subtitle blocks
        blocks = re.split(r'\n\n+', content.strip())... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 5:
Calibre translation plugin isn't recognizing all the content, only the headers, this is weird
It's saying 109 paragraphs when it contains much more. 
What's happening?

### ❓ Question 6:

Let's get the zip path from the main function     input_zip = "/home/zaya/Documents/Gitrepos/Linktrees/all_subtitles.zip"
target_languages = ["zh-ch"]  

        translated_epub = epub_path  # Same location as original
you should expect all_subtitles-db-ch.epub at the same location, but this is the epub that is supposed to be converted to srts

This is the epub translated:
#64

00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,077

the boss invites to have something to eat, it's got very late.

老板邀请吃点东西，已经很晚了

We need to append Chinese transliteration below the chinese line:

from transliteration.translationFunctions import  transliterate, TARGET_PATTERNS, LANGUAGE_CODE_MAP, LANGUAGE_STYLES

def transliterate_srt(input_file: str, target_language: str) -> str:
    """
    Transliterates the text lines in an SRT file based on the target language.
    Skips SRT timestamps and line numbers.

    Args:
        input_file: Path to the input SRT file
        target_language: Language code for transliteration

## Neovim for Screenplay Writing with Lua (2025-08-21)

### ❓ Question 1:
Help me implement/use tools to write a  Director's document/Screenplay for a movie. 
I'm thinking of using nvim shortcuts with lua. What do you think?
All scenes should contain one or more of the following, 
it should there be shortcuts to insert the metadata for each of the following elements:
Scene Number, description
Actors involved in the scene, characters
Dialog, narration
Cinematography description, camera angles, movements, etc
Visual effects?
Sound and music
Costumes
Makeup and hair
Anything else?

It is possible to customize this keymap to i#n where n is the number of parts that I want to use:

vim.keymap.set("n", "i#40", ":for i in range(10, line('$'), 10) | call append(i-1, '# '.i) | endfor", 
    { desc = "Insert # line numbers every 10 lines" })

vim.keymap.set("n", "i#", ":for i in range(1000, line('$'), 1000) | call append(i-1, '# '.i) | endfor", 
    { desc = "Insert # line numbers every 1000 lines" })

### ❓ Question 2:
I like this one, but change it so I can insert the number of as frequency:
Every n lines instead of the number of divisions

### ❓ Question 3:
I like Option 4, but change it so I can insert the number of as frequency:

djvused --version

DJVUSED --- DjVuLibre-3.5.28
Simple DjVu file manipulation program

Usage: djvused [options] djvufile
Executes scripting commands on djvufile.
Script command come either from a script file (option -f),
from the command line (option -e), or from stdin (default).

Options are
  -v               -- verbose
  -f   -- take commands from a file
  -e       -- take commands from the command line
  -s               -- save after execution
  -u               -- produces utf8 instead of escaping non ascii chars
  -n               -- do not save anything

Commands
--------
The following commands can be separated by newlines or semicolons.
Comment lines start with '#'.  Commands usually operate on pages and files
specified by the "select" command.  All pages and files are initially selected.
A single page must be selected before executing commands marked with a period.
Commands marked with an underline do not use the selection

   ls                     -- list all pages/files

### ❓ Question 4:
The styles are loading correctly when I hover over a link to http://localhost:3000/api/home

### ❓ Question 5:
The issue is, the styles are only correct when loading the ones from the home page
When I go directly to http://localhost:3000/blog/posts/Psychoanalysis-Topology-War the styles are not correct
Then if i hover over the link to the home page they update correctly
I want the styles from the home page to be loaded to all pages

// add this to root layout

梦醒后 我还是徘徊在迷雾中的 Somebody
Somebody loves you

Just hold on tight
你不在我身边 却占据我心里

1. Punto de partida ontológico
Spinoza: parte de la idea de substancia única (Dios o la Naturaleza, Deus sive Natura).
Todo lo que existe son modos de esa substancia. El ser no es múltiple en su raíz, sino una
sola realidad infinita que se expresa en infinitos atributos.
Heidegger: parte de la pregunta por el ser mismo, que ha sido olvidada por la metafísica. El
ser no es una cosa ni una substancia, sino la condición de posibilidad de que algo aparezca

Mensagem de casamento para Dafne:

Essa mensagem foi escrita a 14 mãos, uns 100 anos de histórias compartilhadas e muito amor. E que histórias! Desde os momentos de adolescência, cantando Codinome Beija-Flor no Karaokê, criando comunidades no Orkut e escrevendo cartas. Até os momentos do ITA, indo na maromba juntas, dançando forró no tatame, bebendo Big Apple no 112, fofocando no 101, estudando juntas para cada prova e infinitos viradões fazendo trabalhos da civil.

E no meio de todas essas histórias, existe um denominador em comum: A Dafne, e a sua forma única de amar. Quando começamos a escrever essas palavras, foi unânime como a dafne é determinada, fiel, sensível e corajosa. A Dafne é alguém que sentia o mundo. Uma espécie de topologia afetiva, uma forma viva de responder à vida — com intensidade, coragem e coração aberto. Ela sabe demonstrar o quanto ama as pessoas. Ela sempre procura os seus amigos. O amor é uma escolha constante, e ela é muito boa nisso. Nest... [truncated]

A nearly-unconnected subject is one who lives on the edge of ties — an edge that vibrates but does not become entangled. He survives on the edge of language, with the Real invading the Symbolic, trying to reconnect its fissures. He twists, twists, resists."

Explain why this one works:

# Equations

Vamos modelar as **operações clínicas** como transformações dinâmicas sobre o fluxo de gozo em um sistema psíquico topológico (a Garrafa de Klein do sujeito).

---

### **Definições iniciais**

- $G_F(t)$ → Gozo fálico no tempo $t$
- $G_A(t)$ → Gozo alienado / mais-de-gozar no tempo $t$
- $O(t)$ → Objeto de transferência / objeto-relacional
- $S(t)$ → Estado psíquico total do sujeito
- $C(t)$ → Operação de **Corte**
- $W(t)$ → Operação de **Costura** (Weave)
- $A(t)$ → Operação de **Adição de ornamentos / metáforas**

---

### **Equações dinâmicas do fluxo de gozo**

1. **Fluxo sem intervenção** (sistema natural do sujeito):

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} = f(G_F, G_A, O) = \alpha G_F + \beta G_A - \gamma O
$$

- $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ → coeficientes de sensibilidade a cada tipo de gozo e objeto.
- Representa a evolução contínua do estado psíquico.

2. **Efeito do Corte** ($C(t)$):

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} = f(G_F, G_A, O) - \kappa C(t) \cdot G_A
$$

- $\kap... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 8:
Ok, I'll do that. 
Another thing:
Each expression inside $ $ are being rendered in a new line, so it gets weird, I think the should be inlined

Example:
- $G_F(t)$ → Gozo fálico no tempo $t$
- $G_A(t)$ → Gozo alienado / mais-de-gozar no tempo $t$
- $O(t)$ → Objeto de transferência / objeto-relacional
- $S(t)$ → Estado psíquico total do sujeito
- $C(t)$ → Operação de **Corte**
- $W(t)$ → Operação de **Costura** (Weave)
- $A(t)$ → Operação de **Adição de ornamentos / metáforas**

## Psychaoanlysis: Mobius3K Chinese (2025-08-26)

### ❓ Question 1:
Formas de retorno em Freud
RSI
Recalcado, Desmentido, Foraclusao
Palavras em alemão por Freud
Relação entre desmentido e deboche
Relação com a Garrafa de Klein

Dissolução de laços / expulsão devido a essas formas de retorno:
ódio/boca maldita/briga física
Deboche, ironia, falcatrua, desconfiança, mau exemplo, insubordinação
Sintoma, reclusão, silêncio,

Put these in advanced equations that can be understood by chineses, fantasy, forms of building reality, effects of real, expulsion and the above

### ❓ Question 2:
metaphor and metonymy as Lacanian operations

### ❓ Question 3:
Condense both formulas into one: f(S...S' or  S'/S) ≅ S(+-)s
and show how it can be applied to every clinical structure
and to whatever jouissance clinic

### ❓ Question 4:
how do Chinese linguists write this formula or how would they?

### ❓ Question 5:

How this can be resumed into less components and translate to Chinese?

Veil, Semblance... [truncated]

### ❓ Question 6:
The Klein Bottle is the composition of two Moebius Strips
The Moebius Strip is a representant of ambiguity, Doubt
A third transversal Moebius Strip intercepting the Klein Bottle (Cutting and regulating it) acts as a separating operation creating stability/certain/fantasy 
Is the Moebius Strip a common figure in Chinese, how do they represent ambiguity/Doubt/ambivalence?

### ❓ Question 7:
I see this Idea of a three Mobius strips interconnection: Klein bottle scene (3 Moebius Strips Intertwined (Desire, Law, Compromise) + Retorno (Repetição, agência, atualização)) as an original. 
Lacan was working with a 3 partition system for the RSI + Sinthome, with Mobius strips and Klein Bottle. But  I never seem it come together as I did here. 
Are there works relating this 3 Mobius strips into the Klein Bottle and RSI?

It's finding the tags now
The issue is:
The epub was de-ch then I translated to russian then to english, then removed english that wasnt necessary
I should have removed the russian that wasnt necessary
But it gets boring
But now we have tags that are supposed to be russian but have german text

Calibre duplicates the tags:
when translating de-ch to russian
It translates everything
So we have:

## ZayasLanguage: 中文语法结构与颜色编码示例 (2025-10-12)

### ❓ Question 1:
*(truncated)*

Give a similar of this one but for chinese:
Write the translation above as it is, and the transliteration (pinyin) below each word
Keep the color-coded Syntax

Content:
Perfect, Zaya — what you're calling "Unelaborated Parental Enjoyment" (𝐺ₚₙₑ) is, in fact, one of the most fruitful categories for translating the remainder of enjoyment (or *plus-de-jouir*) that could not be symbolized and that, therefore, returns in the next generation as a symptom, destiny, or failure — individual and social.

Let's work on this on three articulated levels:

1. Topological and economic of enjoyment (formal model)
2. Clinical-sociological table (bodies and symptoms)
3. Advanced equations (dynamics of transmission and saturation of enjoyment)

1. Formal model — Topology and economy of Unelaborated Parental Enjoyment (𝐺ₚₙₑ)

Let's imagine the subject and its genealogy as a Klein bottle.
The outer ring is the symbolic field — law, marriage, transmission.
The inner ring is the field of parental enjoym... [truncated]

        elif pos in ['r', 'n'] and i == 0:  # First noun/pronoun often subject
            category = 'S'

        syntax_data.append((word, category, pos))

    return syntax_data

# Test
text = "我今天去学校学习中文"
result = analyze_chinese_approximate_syntax(text)
for word, syntax, pos in result:
    print(f"{word}: POS={pos}, Syntax≈{syntax}")

### ❓ Question 4:
Can we remove the punctuation from the table and have a simple style on them in the translated text (no background color, etc)?
必要	bì yào	need	Adjunct
的	de	of	Other
—	—	None	Other
—	—	None	Other
没有	méi yǒu	No	Verb
它	tā	it	Object
，	，	None	Other
这个	zhè ge	this	Subject
国家	guó jiā	nation	Object

### ❓ Question 5:
Let's use a ruby tag to put it all together and use styles to make sure that we render the translation above the word and the pinyin transliteration below it

Something like:

                {% for item in result %}

                    {{ item.word }}
                    {{ item.translation }}
                    {{ item.transliteration }}

                {% endfor %}

                    Full translation word by word: 
                    {% for item in result %}
                    {{ item.translation }} 
                    {% endfor %}

                    Full translation: Translate the whole text to english (instead of word by word) 

# Complete exclusion set
    exclude_chars = {
        ' ', '.', ',', '!', '?', '。', '，', '！', '？', '、',
        '「', '」', '『', '』', '（', '）', '《', '》', '“', '”',
        '‘', '’', '…', '—', '：', ':', '；', ';', '～', '°', 'º'
    }

### ❓ Question 6:
Let's separate the styles from the html:
For the styles to work we should use something like:

ruby {
    display: inline-flex;
    flex-direction: column-reverse;
    align-items: center;
    margin: 0 5px;
    padding: 5px 10px;
    background-color: #f0f8ff;
    border-radius: 4px;
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 1.8;
}

rt {
    font-size: 14px;
}

rt.translation {
    color: #e74c3c;
    font-weight: bold;
    order: 1;
}

rt:not(.translation) {
    color: #7f8c8d;
    order: -1;
}

Покажи мне, что значит быть одиноким

[Куплет 1: Брайан и Эй Джей ]
Так много слов для разбитого сердца.
Трудно увидеть что-то в багровой любви.
Так трудно дышать.
Пойди со мной, и, может быть,
Ночи света так скоро станут
дикими и свободными, я смогу почувствовать солнце.
Каждое твое желание будет исполнено,
Они говорят мне.

[Припев: Все]
Покажи мне, что значит быть одиноким
Это ли то чувство, с которым мне нужно идти?
Скажи мне, почему я не могу быть там, где ты
В моем сердце чего-то не хватает

[Куплет 2: Кевин и Ник ]
Жизнь продолжается, как будто она никогда не заканчивается
Каменные глаза наблюдают за тенденциями.

Виновные дороги к бесконечной любви (бесконечной любви)
Нет никакого контроля, ты сейчас со мной?
Каждое твое желание будет исполнено

Каждый раз, когда ты смотришь на меня,
Мое сердце подпрыгивает, это легко заметить,
Любовь к тебе значит гораздо больше,
Больше, чем все, что я когда-либо чувствовала.

сможешь ли ты справиться с моей?

[Куплет 1]
Они говорят, что я сумасшедшая, но мне все равно
Это моя прерогатива
Они говорят, что я отвратительная, но мне все равно
Я живу, заводя парней
Некоторые задают мне вопросы: "Почему я такая настоящая?"
Но они меня не понимают
Я действительно не знаю, в чем дело моей сестры
Я изо всех сил пытаюсь все исправить
Не так давно, до того, как я выиграл этот бой

[Припев]
Все говорят обо мне всякую чушь
Почему они просто не оставят меня в живых? (Скажи мне, почему)
Мне не нужно разрешение, я принимаю свои собственные решения (О!)

[Предприпев]
Я хочу верить во все, что ты говоришь
, Потому что это звучит так хорошо.
Но если ты действительно хочешь меня, двигайся медленно.
Есть вещи обо мне, которые тебе просто необходимо знать.

[Припев]
Иногда я убегаю,
Иногда я прячусь,
Иногда я боюсь тебя,
Но всё, чего я хочу, это крепко обнять тебя,
Обращаться с тобой хорошо,
Быть с тобой днём и ночью

Стук, стук, стук в дверь.

Это тебя они все ждут

[Предхор]
Они говорят: «Разве она не прелесть, эта голливудская девчонка?»
И они говорят:

[Припев]
«Ей так повезло, она звезда»
Но она плачет, плачет, плачет в своем одиноком сердце, думая
«Если в моей жизни все в порядке,
то почему по ночам текут слезы?»

[Куплет 2]
Заблудилась в образе, во сне,
Но нет никого, кто мог бы ее разбудить.
И мир вращается, и она продолжает побеждать.
Но скажите мне, что произойдет, когда это прекратится?

Они говорят: «Разве она не прелесть, эта голливудская девчонка?»

Ты меня сбила с толку и запутала.
Всё для меня в новинку
. До сих пор я думала, что знаю любовь.
Терять нечего, и это вредно, потому что
узоры будут рушиться так же быстро, как и я.
Но сейчас

Мосты горят, детка, я учусь
Новому способу думать о
Любви, я вижу, что ничто не будет таким, как прежде Это

Детка, ты такая необычная?
Разве никто не говорил тебе, Что ты должна
Разбить мое сердце? Я жду, что ты этого сделаешь

Только ангел может быть таким необычным
Сладкий сюрприз, к которому я смогу привыкнуть
Необычный ты

Тебе придется посмотреть на меня с моей точки зрения
Мне нужно совершать ошибки, чтобы понять, кто я есть
И я не хочу быть настолько чертовски защищенной

Должен быть другой путь
Потому что я верю в риск
Но кто я такая, чтобы говорить, что делать девушке?
Боже, мне нужны ответы

Что мне делать со своей жизнью? (Ты узнаешь это, не волнуйся)
Как я могу узнать, что правильно? (Тебе просто нужно делать это по-своему)
Я ничего не могу поделать с тем, что чувствую
Но моя жизнь была так чрезмерно защищена

Я скажу им, что мне нравится, чего я хочу, а чего нет

Can we join characters that represent one word into a compound?

This is what I got:
我-S-rwǒ喜-V-vxǐ欢-V-vhuān学-V-vxué习-V-vxí中-O-nzzhōng文-O-nzwén。

I think this is more interesting because it joins multicharacters words into one and it's more clean

Word	Pinyin	Translation	POS Tag	Syntax Role
我	wǒ	I	r	Subject
喜欢	xǐ huān	like	v	Verb
学习	xué xí	study	v	Verb
中文	zhōng wén	Chinese	nz	Object
哇	wa	Wow	y	Preposition
太棒了	tài bàng le	marvelous	nr	Subject

Looking at this code, the part that handles joining Chinese characters into words is in the [code] function, specifically this line:

[code]

This line uses [code] (pseg) to perform word segmentation on the Chinese text. Jieba is a popular Chinese text segmentation library that intelligently groups individual Chinese characters into meaningful words based on its dictionary and statistical models.

Here's how it works:

1. **[code]** - This segments the input Chinese text into words while also performing part-of-speech tagging
2. **[code]** - Conve... [truncated]

Lacanian analysis
Then maybe there’s nothing to it.
I can’t be certain.
I think there is something to it.
I am concerned, to be frank, that my parents may have made advances on me

It's an infinity state of paranoia
Like being tossed around, being handled roughly
Being completely vulnerable as a child
And since they are subjects of jouissance
They're both good and bad
It's being completely vulnerable to that kind of ambivalence

And that's for everyone
Everyone was a baby, a child, vulnerable
Hungry, cold, abandoned into the mechanics of biology
I am tormented by biology

The phantasm of abuse

The issue is that "psychoanalysis" is being detected both as a keyword from the content AND as a theme from the thematic words. Let me fix this by improving the keyword extraction to remove duplicates and improve the logic.

### ❓ Question 8:
Let's create start-chinese-session.sh
/home/zaya/Downloads/Zayas/ZayasTransliteration/start-chinese-session.sh
./start-chinese-session.sh

I want:
1 terminal window with 4 splits, split horizontally and vertically each part:

1:
pwd: /home/zaya/Downloads/Zayas/ZayasTransliteration
Start: Chinese Syntax Analyzer
cd transliteration, pipenv shell, python3 -m web.webChineseColor-coded

2, 3 and 4:
pwd: /home/zaya/Downloads/Zayas/zayas-grammar-db
Start: grammar-db
cd grammar-db
./start.sh

### ❓ Question 9:
This one in start.sh didn't execute correctly, it didnt even go to the backend
echo "🚀 Creating Backend window..."
tmux new-window -t zayas-grammar:1 -c "$PROJECT_ROOT/backend" -n "Backend"
tmux send-keys -t zayas-grammar:1 "pipenv shell && uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000" Enter

Also this one didnt start the webChineseColor-coded
Here since pipenv shell takes a while (less than 10s) to process, we should wait a little, no?
# Start Chinese Syntax Analyzer in pane 0
echo "🔤 Starting Chinese Syntax Analyzer..."
tmux send-keys -t chinese-session:0.0 "echo '=== Chinese Syntax Analyzer ==='" Enter

### ❓ Question 5:
*(truncated)*

This is weird:

Step 4:
KIM requires a Google Keep authentication token in order to run. The token can only be retrieved once you have a Google page OAuth cookie. Install the Chrome extension called 'Cookie Tab Viewer'. Change the directory to where you installed KIM.

Here's the tricky part - you need to get your OAuth token from a Google cookie. To get the OAuth token - follow the "Second way" instructions here (but get the cookie value using the Chrome extension once you've pressed "I agree" on the Google page in the Second way method): https://github.com/rukins/gpsoauth-java?tab=readme-ov-file

Copy the cookie called oauth_token using the Chrome Cookie Tab Viewer from the cookies in your local browser. Then, run the script

> python get_token.py
You will be prompted for your Google email account name, OAuth token, and Android ID

The AndroidID can just be a random value like: abcdef123

So, when you get the prompt when running the script:
Email: your google ID
OAuth Token: oauth2_4... [truncated]

I made an epub like this, the source was a csv file containing en/ch words, at the end I just append them into ruby to get alignment
